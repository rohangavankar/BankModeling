# BankProject

## General info
This project is a bank project. The dataset is a CSV containing many features such as age, job, marital status, and education. 
The project bank file performs ETL on this data to make it cleaner and easier to analyze. I run decision tree, naive bayes, and logistic regression classifiers on this data to predict whether the customer would make a deposit to the bank. Then I build an ensemble model, one with voting, one with bagging, and one with stacking, and compare the three. I reached an accuracy score of 0.9 with the stacking model.  

## Technologies
Use Numpy and Pandas, many SKlearn libraries to import naive bayes, decision tree, KNN, and other classifiers for the ensemble models.
